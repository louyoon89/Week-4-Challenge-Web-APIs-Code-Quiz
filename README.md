# Week-4-Challenge

## Web-APIs-Code-Quiz Challenge
* In our classes' Week 4 challenge we will prepare our journey to become a full stack web developer by completing a coding assessment. We will demonstrate our ability to create an assessment that includes multiple choice questions with interactive coding.

### Challenge Goals
 * Create an app that will run in the browser utilizing HTML and CSS dynamically powered by Javascript code.
 * App will be a timed quiz that will store results/scores of the quiz.
 * Once code base is properly functioning we will have to deploy the application to a live URL and Github URL which displays the site with a proper repository.
